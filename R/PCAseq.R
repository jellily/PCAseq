#' PCAseq: Genetic Population Sturcture Inference with Sequence Data.
#'
#' This package builds on the SNPRelate package by implmeting the PCA-seq method 
#' of population inference for sequence data in a way that is compatible with 
#' existing functions in SNPRelate.
#'
#' The only function you're likely to need from \pkg{roxygen2} is
#' \code{\link{roxygenize}}. Otherwise refer to the vignettes to see
#' how to format the documentation.
