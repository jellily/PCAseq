\usage{

seqPCA(gdsobj, method, sample.id = NULL, snp.id = NULL,
  autosome.only = TRUE, remove.monosnp = TRUE, maf = NaN,
  missing.rate = NaN, eigen.cnt = 32, need.genmat = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdsobj}{an object of the class SNPGDSFileClass, a SNP GDS file.}

\item{method}{a string, either "eigen" or "pcaseq", indicating which method
to use to calculate the GRM; see Details.}

\item{sample.id}{a vector of sample ids specifying the samples to use for
analysis; if NULL, all samples are used.}

\item{snp.id}{a vector of SNP ids specifying the SNps to use for analysis;
if NULL, all SNPs are used.}

\item{autosome.only}{if TRUE, use autosomal SNPs only; if it is a numeric or
character vector, keep SNPs according to the specified chromosomes.}

\item{remove.monosnp}{if TURE, remove monomorphic SNPs.}

\item{maf}{if one number is specified, use SNPs with MAF greater than or
equal to this value; if a numeric vector of length two is specified, only
SNPs with MAFs in (min, max) are taken.}

\item{missing.rate}{to use the SNPs with missing rates less than or equal to
missing.rate; if NaN, no misisng threshold.}

\item{eigen.cnt}{the number of eigen vectors and values to return; if zero,
return all eigenvalues and vectors.}

\item{need.genmat}{if TRUE, return the genetic relatedness matrix.}

\item{verbose}{Not supported.}
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
Return a \code{snpPCAClass} object, a list with the follow slots:
\describe{
\item{\code{method}}{the method used to calculate the GRM}
\item{\code{maf}}{the MAF cutoffs used}
\item{\code{sample.id}}{the sample ids used in the analysis}
\item{\code{snp.id}}{the SNP ids used in the analysis}
\item{\code{eigenval}}{eigenvalues}
\item{\code{eigenvect}}{a matrix of eigenvectors of dimensions # of samples by
\code{eigen.cnt}}
\item{\code{varprop}}{the proportion of the variance explained by each principal
component}
\item{\code{TraceXTX}}{the trace of the genetic relateness matrix}
\item{\code{Bayesian}}{indicates Bayes normalization; set to FALSE, as this is not
currently supported}
\item{\code{genmat}}{the genetic relateness matrix}} method the method used to calculate the GRM
}
\description{
This function calculates the Genetic Relatedness Matrix (GRM) on a GDS file
using the PCA-seq method for sequence data.
}
\details{
If \code{method} is "eigen", the GRM is calculated using the
EIGENSTRAT method as given in Patterson et al 2006. If \code{method} is
"pcaseq", the GRM is calculated using the PCA-seq method.
}
\section{Note}{

If you need to run the EIGENSTRAT method on a very large data set and do not
need to subset by both a minimum and maximum MAF, the
\code{\link[SNPRelate]{snpgdsPCA}} function will be faster.
