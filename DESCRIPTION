Description: This package implements the PCA-seq method for inferring genetic
    population structure using sequence data. It is meant to extend the SNPRelate
    pacakge by allowing the user to run PCA-seq on GDS files, similar to the PCA
    analysis provided by SNPRelate's snpgdsPCA function. Sequence data can be subset
    by both minimum and maxium MAF values. The results are compatible with SNPRelate
    functions such as snpgdsLoadings and snpgdsPCACorr.
