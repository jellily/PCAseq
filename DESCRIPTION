Description: This package implememnts the PCA-seq method for inferring genetic population structure using sequence data. It extends the SNPRelate package by allowing the user to run PCA-seq on GDS files, similar to the PCA analysis provided by the SNPRelate function snpgdsPCA.  Sequence data can be subset by minimum and maximum MAF values. The results are compatible wth SNPRelate functions such as snpgdsLoadings and snpgdsPCACorr.
