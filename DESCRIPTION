Description: This package implements the PCA-seq method for inferring genetic 
  population structure using sequence data. It is meant to extend the
  SNPRelate pacakge by allowing the user to run PCA-seq on GDS files, similar to
  the PCA analysis provided by SNPRelate's snpgdsPCA function. Sequence data
  can be subset by both minimum and maxium MAF values. The results are 
  compatible with SNPRelate functions such as snpgdsLoadings and snpgdsPCACorr.
